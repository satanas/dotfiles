# Dot Files

This repository serves as my way to help me setup and maintain my configuration files. It takes the effort out of
installing everything manually. Feel free to explore, learn and copy parts for your own dotfiles. Enjoy!

# What's included?

* Vim configured with all my plugins, airline and `solarized` theme.

## Using GNU Stow
> GNU Stow is a symlink farm manager which takes distinct sets of software and/or data located in separate directories on the filesystem, and makes them all appear to be installed in a single directory tree.

# Installation

## First time setup:
```
sh -c "$(curl -H 'Cache-Control: no-cache' -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/satanas/dotfiles/master/install.sh)"
```

## Re-execute once everything is installed
```
cd ~/projects/dotfiles
./install.sh
```
